# Mathdle

Video overview on the game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFGANhimME

I enjoyed making this game as I do wordle everyday. Allthough this isn't wordle, its mathdle, I enjoy the concept of guessing games and I think adding the math concepts into program, it made the game fresh and different.

As I mentioned in the video, I challenged with picking a max value. Another challenge that I didn't mention was setting up the colors to match the expressions. This was hard as I had to make multiple functions to represent the color as shown in the output results. I had to use for loops to compare the generated expression with the colors so that the user would know what guesses were close or not.
