# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

I will most likely be doing the number wordle project.

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A wordle like game that has you enter in numbers instead of guessing a 5 letter word.


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will use python as my software. I will include a random number to produce a random sequence of numbers for the user to guess.
I am planning to have my final result as: (number) (operator) (number) = (result)

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I am not planning to combine this final project with another course.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome will me being able to produce a code that implements a random number generator of numbers and their results based on its operator.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Being able to have a grid that portrays the numbers nicely and have a good presentation to show off.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to accomplish a random number generator that produces the numbers and their results based on its operator in an organized way.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to research how regular wordle was made and use the different methods they used to code it in my code, as reference.
