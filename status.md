Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have almost finished the game. I have set up multiple functions that color code
the equation based on the guesses. Also set up the generator that produces the result.
#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I want to be able to prompt the user if they want to play again instead of re-running the code.
Sort of like the hawaii pronunciation project where it prompted you with Y/YES/N/NO
#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

A problem that I have encountered as not being able to stay organized.
I should add more comments so when I look back at my code I know exactly what I'm looking at.
