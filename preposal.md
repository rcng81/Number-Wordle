# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

The main idea I have for my final project would be a wordle type game.
Instead of words, we would replace it with numbers/equations.
It would be just like wordle: 
Having a right number in the right spot(green)
Having a right number in the wrong spot(yellow)
And having a wrong number (red)

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

N/A

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Does this project seem like it would be too little or too much work?
